# expense-tracker-python
The Expense Tracker is a simple Python console application that helps you manage your daily expenses.
It allows you to add, view, and analyze your spending habits, while storing everything in a CSV file so your data is never lost.

This project was built to practice Python fundamentals, file handling, and problem-solving. It’s lightweight and phone-friendly (can run on Replit or Pydroid).
